# CReMa

Welcome to CReMa - the Console Reference Manager!
I have started this project when I was looking into alternatives to popular
reference managers such as Mendeley, which has more features than I use on a
regular basis and does not allow me to work from the command line which is
where I spent most of the time that I spent on the computer.

Hence, I have decided to make it my own task of implementing a simple, yet
fast, reference manager. CReMa is written in Python and uses SQLite3 as its
database in the background.

The features which I consider most important to me are:
* adding references via DOI
* adding reference PDFs and determining DOI automatically
* querying the database by author, title, year, tags, etc.
* exporting citations of queries

Some additional features which I consider nice to have are:
* previewing the abstract of a paper
* opening attached PDFs with an external application
